# Solar System Simulation

This project provides a basic simulation of the solar system with a graphical representation and simple animation, built using the Turbo C graphics library. It visualizes the planets orbiting the sun and demonstrates the principles of motion in the solar system through simple graphics and animation.

## Features

- **Graphical Representation:** Displays the sun and planets in a 2D view.
- **Planetary Orbits:** Simulates the planets' movement around the sun with simple orbital animation.
- **Basic Animation:** Uses Turbo C graphics to animate the planetary motion.

## Technologies Used

- **Turbo C**: Programming environment and compiler.
- **Turbo C Graphics Library**: For creating the graphical user interface and animation.
- **C Programming Language**: The core language used to develop the simulation.

## Setup and Installation

1. Install Turbo C or any compatible C compiler that supports the Turbo C graphics library.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-system-simulation.git
   ```
3. Open the project directory in Turbo C or your preferred C IDE.
4. Compile and run the `solar_system.c` file to start the simulation.

## Usage

1. **Start the Simulation**: After running the program, you will see a graphical window displaying the sun and the planets in orbit.
2. **Animation**: The planets will start moving around the sun in their respective orbits.
3. **Exit**: Close the window to stop the simulation.

## Code Explanation

- The program initializes the graphics mode using the Turbo C graphics library.
- The sun is represented at the center, and the planets are drawn in orbit with basic motion logic.
- Simple animation techniques are used to update the positions of the planets on each frame, simulating their orbits around the sun.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to improve the simulation or add new features, feel free to submit a pull request.
